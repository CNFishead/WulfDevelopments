          From Early on in Austin's youth, technology seemed to come easy to
          him. Much like most people who pursue tech as a field. Austin had a
          constant yearning to consume technology. One of Austin's very first
          memories for technology came early about the first grade. The class
          was having a show-and-tell and a classmate had brought a computer game
          for the class to play on the teachers computer. The teacher had
          difficulty with the installation of the game, all until Austin gave it
          a shot, he was able to install the game and the class was able to
          enjoy the content. However it didnt dawn on Austin just what something
          like this meant until later in life.

          Growing up in Southeast Appalachia, public education did what public
          education does best. It trained Austin to work long monotonous hours
          with the intent to either work in a factory or work in a coal mine.
          from the very beginning Austin knew that he would not be taking this
          kind of path in life. However it wasnt until he was in 8th grade that
          he knew what he wanted to do exactly with his life.

        <p className="storyText">
          8th Grade brought Austin an amazing opportunity with schooling, it was
          then on the very last few weeks of 8th grade that the high school was
          partnering with the local community college to offer a course to
          grades 9-12, the course was known as Project-Lead-The-Way or PLTW, in
          its design it was to offer students a glance into the wonderful world
          of engineering by exposing prospective students to different fields of
          study. Such areas included CAD, Architecture and Electrical
          engineering. Austin fell in love with Electrical Engineering. Finally
          the world seemed a lot clearer. Austin began to devour these courses,
          so much so that his only reason for wanting to go to school was to
          atend these courses. From there it seemed like the future was known
          and Austin had a motto for his life. "To build a better future, we
          must create today." However life had its other plans.

        <p className="storyText">
          It was in high school that Austin met the love of his life, His wife.
          Many things would change in that time, and ultimately it would lead to
          the point where it was unfeasible to pursue an Electrical Engineering
          Degree. In fact, it would seem that Austin would fall back into the
          mold that so many did, as he entered General non-skilled labor
          positions. Though this would turn to be a blessing in disguise. One
          fate-filled day while working an over-night position at Wal-Mart.
          Austin overheard a couple coworkers talking about playing Dungeons and
          Dragons. The idea of D&D intrigued Austin. After all, as an avid gamer
          RPG's where among the most favored. it was here with this group of
          rag-tag co-workers looking for a release from the work week. That
          Austin would discover the next step in his life.
        </p>
        <p className="storyText">
          As it would stand, running up to Dragons is likely the quickest way to
          die in D&D. It became a running joke of how long my characters would
          last but it was in this flurry of mistakes that Austin noticed
          something. character creation, is a long tedious process to do on
          paper... An idea was hatched to create a character creator program
          that would speed up the process. From that idea came the realization
          that Software Development would be an amazing field to pursue. The
          concept was nearly the same as what had been thought earlier in
          Austins life "To build a better future, we must create today." The
          process of automation through software. Make life better by automating
          away the tediousness of life's problems.
        </p>
        <p className="storyText">
          From there Austin began to do a lot of research and self-teaching for
          Software Development starting with the book, "Python For The Absolute
          Begginer" and coming to a head of where Austin is now. With a combined
          knowledge from professional institutions, and self-learning. Austin
          wants to change the world through code. Automating processes and parts
          of life to make living easier.

          Austin would begin to pursue a job at first with CookSystem a
          technical recruiting company that takes Jr. Software Developers, train
          them, and place them with a job. Here Austin was able to gather the
          skills necessary for his next step in life. Salt Shaker Media. Salt
          Shaker Media is Austin's first professional experience in the field of
          Software Development.
