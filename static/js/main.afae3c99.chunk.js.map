junior software developer with a passion\r\n          for code and solid background of superior performance in foundational\r\n          roles. He is a diligent, self-directed learner with more than 4 years\r\n          of personal study, as well as instruction at professional educational\r\n          institutions. Austin is proficient with several full-stack languages,\r\n          frameworks, and libraries. He is also experienced in the day-to-day\r\n          operations of businesses and the importance of each role within an\r\n          organization.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"storyText\">\r\n          From Early on in Austin's youth, technology seemed to come easy to\r\n          him. Much like most people who pursue tech as a field. Austin had a\r\n          constant yearning to consume technology. One of Austin's very first\r\n          memories for technology came early about the first grade. The class\r\n          was having a show-and-tell and a classmate had brought a computer game\r\n          for the class to play on the teachers computer. The teacher had\r\n          difficulty with the installation of the game, all until Austin gave it\r\n          a shot, he was able to install the game and the class was able to\r\n          enjoy the content. However it didnt dawn on Austin just what something\r\n          like this meant until later in life.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"storyText\">\r\n          Growing up in Southeast Appalachia, public education did what public\r\n          education does best. It trained Austin to work long monotonous hours\r\n          with the intent to either work in a factory or work in a coal mine.\r\n          from the very beginning Austin knew that he would not be taking this\r\n          kind of path in life. However it wasnt until he was in 8th grade that\r\n          he knew what he wanted to do exactly with his life.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"storyText\">\r\n          8th Grade brought Austin an amazing opportunity with schooling, it was\r\n          then on the very last few weeks of 8th grade that the high school was\r\n          partnering with the local community college to offer a course to\r\n          grades 9-12, the course was known as Project-Lead-The-Way or PLTW, in\r\n          its design it was to offer students a glance into the wonderful world\r\n          of engineering by exposing prospective students to different fields of\r\n          study. Such areas included CAD, Architecture and Electrical\r\n          engineering. Austin fell in love with Electrical Engineering. Finally\r\n          the world seemed a lot clearer. Austin began to devour these courses,\r\n          so much so that his only reason for wanting to go to school was to\r\n          atend these courses. From there it seemed like the future was known\r\n          and Austin had a motto for his life. \"To build a better future, we\r\n          must create today.\" However life had its other plans.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"storyText\">\r\n          It was in high school that Austin met the love of his life, His wife.\r\n          Many things would change in that time, and ultimately it would lead to\r\n          the point where it was unfeasible to pursue an Electrical Engineering\r\n          Degree. In fact, it would seem that Austin would fall back into the\r\n          mold that so many did, as he entered General non-skilled labor\r\n          positions. Though this would turn to be a blessing in disguise. One\r\n          fate-filled day while working an over-night position at Wal-Mart.\r\n          Austin overheard a couple coworkers talking about playing Dungeons and\r\n          Dragons. The idea of D&D intrigued Austin. After all, as an avid gamer\r\n          RPG's where among the most favored. it was here with this group of\r\n          rag-tag co-workers looking for a release from the work week. That\r\n          Austin would discover the next step in his life.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"storyText\">\r\n          As it would stand, running up to Dragons is likely the quickest way to\r\n          die in D&D. It became a running joke of how long my characters would\r\n          last but it was in this flurry of mistakes that Austin noticed\r\n          something. character creation, is a long tedious process to do on\r\n          paper... An idea was hatched to create a character creator program\r\n          that would speed up the process. From that idea came the realization\r\n          that Software Development would be an amazing field to pursue. The\r\n          concept was nearly the same as what had been thought earlier in\r\n          Austins life \"To build a better future, we must create today.\" The\r\n          process of automation through software. Make life better by automating\r\n          away the tediousness of life's problems.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"storyText\">\r\n          From there Austin began to do a lot of research and self-teaching for\r\n          Software Development starting with the book, \"Python For The Absolute\r\n          Begginer\" and coming to a head of where Austin is now. With a combined\r\n          knowledge from professional institutions, and self-learning. Austin\r\n          wants to change the world through code. Automating processes and parts\r\n          of life to make living easier.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p className=\"storyText\">\r\n          Austin would begin to pursue a job at first with CookSystem a\r\n          technical recruiting company that takes Jr. Software Developers, train\r\n          them, and place them with a job. Here Austin was able to gather the\r\n          skills necessary for his next step in life. Salt Shaker Media. Salt\r\n          Shaker Media is Austin's first professional experience in the field of\r\n          Software Development.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport
